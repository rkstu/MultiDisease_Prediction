## Introduction

Welcome to the MultiDisease Prediction project! In this repository, we have developed machine learning models and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application for the efficient and accurate prediction of multiple diseases using Machine Learning algorithms. Our models achieve an average accuracy of over 85%, providing valuable insights for disease diagnosis and prevention.

## Project Description

Our project encompasses the following key achievements:

- **Machine Learning Models:** We have developed a diverse ensemble of Machine Learning models to predict multiple diseases. These models are trained on relevant medical data, resulting in an average prediction accuracy of over 85%.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** We have created a user-friendly GUI application that allows users to input medical data and receive disease predictions. The GUI enhances accessibility and ease of use.

- **Individual Disease Probability Scores:** Our models not only predict diseases but also provide individual probability scores for each disease. This additional information improves user confidence in the predictions.

- **Libraries Used:** We utilized various libraries, including pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Streamlit, to develop and deploy our models and GUI application.
